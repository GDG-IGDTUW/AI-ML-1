## 📂 Project Details  

### 1️⃣ **VibeLift**  

👩‍💼 **Description:**  
VibeLift is a polished, tablet-inspired web application designed to help users track and improve their emotional well-being. 
By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), the app analyzes user-submitted text to predict their current emotion and provides tailored wellness exercises to "lift" their vibe.

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- Provides tailored wellness exercises  
- NLP  

---

### 2️⃣ **Moodify**  

🏏 **Description:**  
A web application built with Streamlit and scikit-learn that classifies the 
dominant emotion (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) from song lyrics and suggests related songs from a database with the same predicted 'vibe'.

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- Classifies the dominant emotion
- Provides related songs 

---

### 3️⃣ **NINA (News Intelligence Neural Analyzer)**  

📚 **Description:**  
NINA is a smart news verification tool that classifies articles as real or fake using state-of-the-art NLP embeddings and machine learning. 
By analyzing the content of news articles, it helps users identify potentially misleading information. 

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- Identifies potentially misleading information 
- Uses state-of-the-art NLP embeddings
- NLP

### 4️⃣ **ReMixRecipe**  

🥹 **Description:**  
ReMixRecipe is a tool that helps you figure out what cuisine you can cook using the ingredients you already have. Instead of searching for recipes by name, you enter your leftover ingredients, and the system predicts which type of cuisine (like Italian, Mexican, or Indian) you can make. 
It uses a machine learning model trained on recipes to do this automatically.
👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- System predicts which type of cuisine

### 5️⃣ **ResuMatch**  

💳 **Description:**  
"ResuMatch is a simple, beginner-friendly web application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes. It compares a resume
PDF with a job description and provides a match percentage, along with highlighting missing keywords. This helps users improve 
their resume’s compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)."

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- Compares a resume PDF with a job description
- provides a match percentage
