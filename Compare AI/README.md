# Text Similarity & Plagiarism Detection using NLP

## Overview

This project detects similarity between two text documents to identify potential plagiarism. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert text into numerical representations and calculates similarity scores using machine learning methods.

## Objective

* Measure similarity between two texts
* Detect plagiarized or highly similar content
* Understand semantic similarity beyond exact word matching

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Scikit-learn
* TF-IDF / Cosine Similarity
* Streamlit

## Results

The system outputs a similarity score between documents. Higher scores indicate greater similarity and possible plagiarism.

## Future Enhancements

* Use word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)
* Support for multiple documents
* Web interface using Flask or Streamlit
* PDF and DOC file support

## Use Cases

* Academic plagiarism detection
* Document comparison
* Content originality checking
