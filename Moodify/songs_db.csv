Supermarket Flowers,Ed Sheeran,I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill. I threw the day old tea from the cup. Packed up the photo that's in the card on the mirror. Finally cleaned the 7 days of ginger ale bottles up. So I'll sing Hallelujah. You were an angel in the shape of my mum. When I fell down you'd be there holding me up. Spread your wings as you go.

Zombie,The Cranberries,"Another head hangs lowly. Child is slowly taken. And the violence, caused such silence. Who are we mistaken? But you see, it's not me. It's not my family.

Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie. What's in your head, in your head.",fear,https://youtu.be/6Ejga4kJUts
Hurt,Johnny Cash,I hurt myself today. To see if I still feel. I focus on the pain. The only thing that's real. The needle tears a hole. The old familiar sting. Try to kill it all away.

I will make you hurt.,fear,https://youtu.be/8AHCfZTRGiI

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day.",surprise,https://youtu.be/GLvohMXgcsc
